# starburst_sdss_spectra

 data_download_code.ipynb downloads FITS files for galaxies from SDSS using known plate, MJD, and fiberID numbers. To use this notebook correctly, prepare a .txt file containing the plate, MJD, and fiberID values of the sources you want to access.

bpt_table.ipynb extracts the emission line parameters you want from the downloaded FITS files and converts them into a table. Make sure to decide which spectral lines and parameters you need, and adapt the code to your specific use case.
